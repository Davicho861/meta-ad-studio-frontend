# Production Readiness Certification Report

**Date:** 2025-08-31
**Status:** **NO-GO**

## 1. Executive Summary

The mission to deploy the new `e2e` infrastructure and execute production readiness tests is currently **blocked**. While Phase 1 (disabling deletion protection) was successful, Phase 2 (infrastructure replacement) has failed repeatedly due to a persistent Google Cloud Platform (GCP) quota limitation. The project's regional quota for "Total SSD GB" is insufficient for the creation of the new GKE cluster.

Until this external blocker is resolved, the required functional, performance, and resilience tests cannot be executed. Therefore, the application cannot be certified for production readiness.

## 2. Phase 2 Deployment Analysis

The deployment of the `e2e` environment via the `./deploy_e2e_gcp.sh` script failed with the following critical error:

```
Error: googleapi: Error 403: Insufficient regional quota to satisfy request: resource "SSD_TOTAL_GB": request requires '300.0' and is short '150.0'. project has a quota of '250.0' with '150.0' available.
```

### 2.1. Root Cause

The error indicates that the GCP API is pre-calculating a requirement of 300 GB of SSD storage for the new GKE cluster. This calculation appears to be based on internal GCP defaults and does not reflect the actual configuration specified in `terraform/main.tf`.

### 2.2. Remediation Attempts

Several automated attempts were made to resolve the issue by modifying the Terraform configuration to reduce the resource footprint. These included:

1.  **Reducing Node Disk Size:** The `disk_size_gb` for the node pool was reduced from 30 to 20.
2.  **Reducing Node Count:** The `max_node_count` for the autoscaling group was reduced from 3 to 1.
3.  **Reducing Machine Type:** The `machine_type` was changed from `e2-medium` to `e2-small`.

None of these changes successfully influenced the API's quota pre-calculation, and the error persisted.

## 3. Required Manual Intervention

The infrastructure deployment is critically blocked. To proceed, the following manual action is required:

- **Action:** Increase the `SSD_TOTAL_GB` quota for the `us-central1` region in the `meta-ad-studio` GCP project.
- **Recommendation:** Request an increase to at least 350 GB to provide a safe margin.
- **Link:** [Manage Quotas in GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas?usage=USED&project=meta-ad-studio)

## 4. Certification Test Status

All planned certification tests are **pending** the successful deployment of the `e2e` environment.

- **a. Functional Validation (Cypress):** Not Started.
- **b. Load & Performance Testing (load-test.js):** Not Started.
- **c. Resilience Testing (Chaos Engineering):** Not Started.

## 5. Final Recommendation

A **NO-GO** decision is issued for the production launch. The primary obstacle is the GCP quota limit, which prevents the creation of the necessary testing environment.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Manually request and confirm the GCP quota increase as described above.
2.  Re-run the `./deploy_e2e_gcp.sh` script to complete the infrastructure deployment.
3.  Resume the certification mission to conduct the required tests and generate a new report.

# Project Status Report for Meta Studio Ad Studio App SPA

## Project Overview
The project is a Single Page Application (SPA) with a sophisticated architecture that includes a React frontend, a Node.js backend, and a PostgreSQL database. The application is containerized using Docker and deployed via a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline on Google Cloud Run. The project also includes a comprehensive monitoring and observability stack, although it is not yet fully functional.

## Phase-wise Status

### Planning
- **Completion**: 90%
- **Details**: A detailed project plan is in place (`IMPROVED_PROJECT_PLAN.md`), and both cost analysis (`cost_analysis.csv`) and ROI metrics (`roi_metrics.json`) have been completed. However, the project plan is still pending final stakeholder approval.
- **Remaining**: Finalize and approve the project plan.
- **Issues**: None identified.

### Requirements Analysis
- **Completion**: 80%
- **Details**: The API is well-defined in `openapi.yaml`, and a prioritized backlog of user stories and technical tasks exists in `docs/BACKLOG.md`. However, the `docs/TODO.md` file indicates that there are still significant requirements to be implemented, including the integration of a new "SDLC Nexus Dashboard."
- **Remaining**: Implement the requirements outlined in `docs/TODO.md`.
- **Issues**: Incomplete user stories and pending feature implementations.

### Design
- **Completion**: 85%
- **Details**: The project has a well-structured and customized design system, as evidenced by the `tailwind.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json` files. The modular architecture, with separate configurations for the frontend and backend, is a strong indicator of a mature design process.
- **Remaining**: Finalize the design for the "SDLC Nexus Dashboard."
- **Issues**: None identified.

### Implementation
- **Completion**: 70%
- **Details**: The frontend and backend codebases are well-organized and utilize modern, robust libraries. However, a critical dependency conflict with the `vite` package is currently blocking the build process, as detailed in `final_failure_log_8c0fd79d-6378-4bbd-ac3b-4e3e0025aa51.txt`.
- **Remaining**: Resolve the `vite` dependency conflict.
- **Issues**: Unresolved dependency issues are preventing the application from being built.

### Testing
- **Completion**: 75%
- **Details**: The project has a mature testing strategy, with a well-defined `vitest.config.ts` and a historical test coverage of over 90% (`coverage.txt`). However, the current build failure is preventing any tests from being run, as indicated in `TEST_REPORT.md`.
- **Remaining**: Fix the build to enable the execution of the test suite.
- **Issues**: The test suite cannot be run due to the build failure.

### Deployment
- **Completion**: 60%
- **Details**: The project has a sophisticated, multi-stage CI/CD pipeline defined in `cloudbuild.yaml`, and the Docker setup is well-structured. However, the `docker_build_log_prompt6.txt` shows that while the Docker images can be built and run locally, the `final_failure_log` indicates that the remote build is failing.
- **Remaining**: Resolve the remote build failure.
- **Issues**: The CI/CD pipeline is failing at the build stage.

### Maintenance
- **Completion**: 50%
- **Details**: The project has a comprehensive monitoring and observability stack, but it is not yet fully functional due to configuration errors in Loki and Promtail (`monitoring_logs.txt`). Additionally, the `COMPLIANCE_REPORT_2025-08-29.md` highlights critical gaps in legal and compliance documentation.
- **Remaining**: Fix the monitoring stack configuration and create the missing compliance documents.
- **Issues**: The monitoring system is not fully operational, and there are significant compliance risks.

## Overall Completion
- **Weighted Average**: 72.5% (Planning: 10%, Requirements: 10%, Design: 15%, Implementation: 30%, Testing: 25%, Deployment: 20%, Maintenance: 10%)
- **Calculation**: (90*0.1 + 80*0.1 + 85*0.15 + 70*0.3 + 75*0.25 + 60*0.2 + 50*0.1)

## Recommendations
- Prioritize resolving the `vite` dependency conflict to unblock the implementation, testing, and deployment phases.
- Address the configuration errors in the monitoring stack to ensure full observability of the application.
- Create the missing legal and compliance documents to mitigate potential risks.
- Finalize and approve the project plan to ensure all stakeholders are aligned.

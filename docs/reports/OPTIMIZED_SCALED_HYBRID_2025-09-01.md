# Optimized and Scaled Hybrid Deployment Report

**Date:** 2025-09-01

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the autonomous optimization and scaling of the 'Meta Studio Ad Studio App SPA' in a hybrid GCP-local environment. The initial state of the deployment was evaluated, and several optimizations were applied. However, significant blockers were encountered that prevented the completion of all planned tasks.

## 2. Initial State Evaluation

The initial evaluation of the hybrid deployment revealed several areas for improvement:

*   **GKE Scaling:** No Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) were configured, leaving the application vulnerable to traffic spikes.
*   **Cloud Run:** Several services were in a failed state, indicating deployment or configuration issues.
*   **Cost Analysis:** The provided `cost_analysis.csv` file was for an AWS environment and not relevant to the GCP deployment.
*   **Compliance:** The compliance report indicated that critical documentation for GDPR and other policies was missing.

## 3. Applied Optimizations

The following automatic fixes were successfully applied:

*   **GKE Autoscaling:** A Horizontal Pod Autoscaler was configured in `k8s/hpa.yaml` to automatically scale the application based on CPU utilization and custom metrics from Prometheus.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** The `cloudbuild.yaml` file was optimized to use Kaniko for cached Docker builds and to run build and push steps in parallel, significantly improving pipeline performance.
*   **Custom Metrics for HPA:** The Prometheus Adapter was deployed to expose custom metrics to the Kubernetes Custom Metrics API, enabling the HPA to scale on application-specific metrics.
*   **Automated Compliance Checks:** The `cloudbuild.yaml` file was updated to include automated compliance checks using Trivy for vulnerability scanning and OPA for policy enforcement.
*   **Multi-Region Redundancy:** The `multi-cloud/federation.yaml` file was updated to enable the GCP provider, laying the groundwork for a multi-cloud deployment.

## 4. Blockers Encountered

The following blockers prevented the completion of several key tasks:

*   **Istio Installation:** The installation of Istio failed due to insufficient CPU and memory resources on the GKE cluster nodes. An attempt to create a new node pool with a larger machine type was blocked by a project quota limit.
*   **Spot VMs:** An attempt to enable Spot VMs on the existing node pool failed as the `gcloud` command does not support updating an existing node pool to use Spot VMs.
*   **Ingress Controller:** The GKE ingress controller failed to provision an external IP address for the application, preventing the execution of the load test, chaos engineering, and WAF updates. The root cause appears to be the ingress controller's inability to find the `frontend-service` and `backend-service`, even though they exist in the cluster.

## 5. Next Steps

The following next steps are recommended to address the blockers and complete the optimization and scaling of the deployment:

*   **Increase Project Quotas:** Request an increase in the project's CPU and SSD quotas to allow for the creation of a new GKE node pool with sufficient resources to run Istio.
*   **Troubleshoot Ingress Controller:** Investigate the GKE ingress controller to determine why it is unable to find the application's services. This may involve checking the controller's logs and configuration.
*   **Complete End-to-End Validation:** Once the ingress is functional, complete the end-to-end validation by running the load test, chaos engineering, and WAF updates.
*   **Implement A/B Testing:** With Istio installed, implement A/B testing using its traffic shifting capabilities.
*   **Full Multi-Cloud Federation:** Enable the AWS and Azure providers in the `multi-cloud/federation.yaml` file to achieve a full multi-cloud deployment.
*   **AI/ML Integration:** Begin training ML models in Vertex AI to enhance the application's ad personalization features.
*   **Production Rollout:** Plan and execute a full production rollout using a blue-green deployment strategy in GKE.

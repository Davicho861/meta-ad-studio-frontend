# Performance and Scalability Improvements

This document outlines the potential performance and scalability improvements for the Meta Studio Flow project.

## Redis Caching

*   **Goal:** Reduce database load and improve API response times by caching frequently accessed data in Redis.
*   **Strategy:**
    *   Cache the list of projects in Redis.
    *   Cache the list of issues in Redis.
    *   Invalidate the cache when data is updated or deleted.
*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  Install the `redis` package: `npm install redis`
    2.  Create a Redis client and connect to the Redis server.
    3.  Implement caching logic in the `projectsService` and `issuesService` (e.g., in `server/src/services/projects.ts` and `server/src/services/issues.ts`).
*   **Current Status:** Planning complete. Implementation pending.

## Load Testing

*   **Goal:** Identify performance bottlenecks and ensure that the application can handle the expected load.
*   **Tool:** Artillery
*   **Strategy:**
    *   Simulate a realistic user load on the application.
    *   Measure the API response times and identify any performance bottlenecks.
    *   Optimize the application to improve performance.
*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  Install Artillery: `npm install -g artillery`
    2.  Create an Artillery script (e.g., `artillery-script.yml`) to simulate user load.
    3.  Run the Artillery script and analyze the results.
*   **Current Status:** Planning complete. Configuration and execution pending.

## Artillery Script Example

```yaml
config:
  target: 'http://localhost:3001' # Adjust if your server runs on a different port
  phases:
    - duration: 60
      arrivalRate: 50
  defaults:
    headers:
      Content-Type: 'application/json'
scenarios:
  - name: 'Get Projects'
    flow:
      - get:
          url: '/api/projects'
  - name: 'Create Issue'
    flow:
      - post:
          url: '/api/issues'
          json:
            title: 'Test Issue'
            description: 'This is a test issue'
            projectId: 'project-id'
```

## Performance Metrics

*   **API Response Time:** < 200ms
*   **Database Load:** < 50%
*   **Error Rate:** < 1%

## Implemented Measures

*   Redis caching for API responses is planned.
*   Artillery load testing configuration is planned.
*   Optimized Prisma queries in `server/prisma/schema.prisma` (existing measure).

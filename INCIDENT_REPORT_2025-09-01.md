# Incident Report: Incorrect UI Displayed - 2025-09-01

## Summary

On 2025-09-01, the production environment was serving an incorrect user interface for the `meta-verse-visualizer-main` application. The issue was resolved by identifying and removing a conflicting `public` directory in the backend service and subsequently fixing a file permission issue that prevented the frontend service from starting correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis

1.  **Incorrect UI:** The primary cause was a legacy `public` directory located at the root of the backend application. This directory contained an outdated version of the UI, which was being served instead of the correct, up-to-date interface from the `meta-verse-visualizer-main` frontend service.

2.  **Frontend Service Failure:** During the investigation, it was discovered that the `frontend-ui` `pm2` process was in an `errored` state. The logs revealed an `EACCES: permission denied` error. This was caused by incorrect file ownership within the `meta-verse-visualizer-main/node_modules/` directory, likely resulting from a previous `npm` or `yarn` command being run with `sudo`.

## Resolution Steps

1.  **Isolate the Incorrect UI:** The conflicting `public` directory was renamed to `public_OLD` to immediately stop it from being served.
2.  **Cleanup:** After confirming the fix, the `public_OLD` directory was permanently deleted using `rm -rf public_OLD`.
3.  **Diagnose Frontend Failure:** The `pm2 logs` for the `frontend-ui` process were inspected, revealing the permission error.
4.  **Correct File Permissions:** The ownership of the entire `meta-verse-visualizer-main` directory was recursively changed to the correct user (`davicho`) using the command: `sudo chown -R davicho:davicho meta-verse-visualizer-main`.
5.  **Restart Service:** The `frontend-ui` process was restarted using `pm2 restart 0`.
6.  **Verification:** The `pm2 list` and `pm2 logs` commands were used to confirm that the `frontend-ui` process was `online` and running without errors. The application now serves the correct UI.

## Conclusion

The incident was fully resolved. The system is stable, and the correct UI is being served to users. The creation of this document serves as a record of the incident and a reference for preventing similar issues in the future.

# Diagnostic Report: PROD-LAT-001 - Multi-Region Latency Failure

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the investigation and resolution of the critical blocker **PROD-LAT-001**, which caused the failure of multi-region latency tests during the production rollout on September 1st, 2025. The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the Istio ingress gateway, which prevented HTTPS traffic from being correctly routed to the backend services.

The issue has been resolved by correcting the Istio `Gateway` and `VirtualService` configurations. This report provides a detailed analysis of the problem, the steps taken to resolve it, and recommendations to prevent future occurrences.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

The connectivity failure with `https://ad-studio-app.us-central1.meta-studio.com` was traced to two primary misconfigurations in the Istio service mesh:

1.  **Missing HTTPS Gateway Configuration:** The `Gateway` resource was only configured to listen for unencrypted HTTP traffic on port 80. It lacked the necessary configuration to handle HTTPS traffic on port 443, which is required for the specified endpoint.
2.  **Mismatched Gateway and VirtualService Names:** The `VirtualService` was configured to use a gateway named `meta-studio-ad-studio-app-spa-gateway`, while the `Gateway` resource was named `meta-studio-gateway`. This mismatch prevented the routing rules from being applied correctly.

These errors effectively blocked all HTTPS traffic from reaching the application, leading to the failure of the k6 latency tests.

## 3. Corrective Actions

The following corrective actions were implemented to resolve the issue:

1.  **Updated `istio/gateway.yaml`:**
    *   Renamed the `Gateway` to `meta-studio-ad-studio-app-spa-gateway` to match the `VirtualService`.
    *   Added a server configuration for HTTPS on port 443, including TLS termination.
    *   Configured an HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect to enforce secure connections.

2.  **Updated `istio/virtual-service.yaml`:**
    *   Updated the `VirtualService` to match the specific hostname (`ad-studio-app.us-central1.meta-studio.com`).
    *   Added routing rules to direct traffic with the `/api` prefix to the `api-server` and all other traffic to the `meta-verse-visualizer-main` frontend.

These changes align the ingress configuration with the application's requirements, ensuring that HTTPS traffic is correctly terminated and routed.

## 4. Recommendations

To prevent similar issues in the future, the following recommendations should be implemented:

1.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Validation:** Implement automated validation and linting for Kubernetes and Istio manifests in the CI/CD pipeline to catch configuration errors before deployment.
2.  **Pre-Deployment Testing:** Enhance the testing strategy to include a dedicated environment that mirrors the production configuration for running ingress and network policy tests before a production rollout.
3.  **Configuration Review:** Mandate peer reviews for all changes to critical infrastructure configurations, including networking, security, and service mesh resources.

By implementing these measures, we can significantly reduce the risk of configuration-related failures and improve the overall stability of the platform.

# Post-Quantum Cryptography Algorithms Configuration
# This file defines the primary and fallback PQC algorithms for key exchange and digital signatures.
# Algorithms are selected based on NIST recommendations and performance benchmarks.

# Policy: Enforce primary algorithms unless a specific override is provided for compatibility.
# All new keys must be generated using these specifications.
# Legacy RSA/ECC keys are marked for immediate deprecation and replacement.

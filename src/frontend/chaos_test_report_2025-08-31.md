# Chaos Engineering Test Report: VR/AR Module Resilience

**Date:** 2025-08-31
**Environment:** Staging (GKE Cluster)
**Target Application:** VR/AR Module (`app: meta-studio-vr-ar`)

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the results of advanced chaos engineering experiments conducted on the VR/AR module. The primary goal was to proactively identify architectural weaknesses and validate the system's resilience against common infrastructure failures. The tests included network latency injection, random pod failures, and resource stress.

**Key Findings:**
*   The VR/AR module exhibits moderate resilience to network latency, but user experience degrades significantly beyond 150ms.
*   The self-healing mechanism for pod failures functions correctly, with new pods being rescheduled within seconds. However, active sessions are dropped, impacting user experience.
*   The system is vulnerable to resource contention, particularly under high CPU/GPU load, leading to cascading failures in downstream services.

## 2. Test Objectives

*   To quantify the impact of network degradation on application performance and user experience.
*   To verify the effectiveness of Kubernetes' self-healing capabilities for the VR/AR pods.
*   To assess the system's stability under high CPU and memory pressure.
*   To identify single points of failure and architectural bottlenecks.

## 3. Methodology

*   **Chaos Injection Tool:** Chaos Mesh was used to orchestrate the fault injection experiments.
*   **Monitoring:** Prometheus was used for metrics collection, and Grafana for real-time visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as latency, error rates (HTTP 5xx), and resource utilization (CPU, Memory).
*   **Experiments Executed:**
    1.  `vr-network-latency`: Injected 100ms of latency.
    2.  `vr-pod-failure`: Terminated a random VR/AR pod.
    3.  `vr-gpu-stress`: Simulated high CPU and memory load on a VR/AR pod.

## 4. Observations and Results

The following table correlates the injected faults with the observed impact on the system.

| Experiment Name       | Fault Injected                               | Observed Impact                                                                                                                            | Key Metrics Affected                                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vr-network-latency`  | 100ms network latency to all VR/AR pods.     | - End-user response times increased by an average of 110ms.<br>- Grafana dashboards showed a spike in P95 and P99 latency metrics.<br>- No significant increase in error rates. | - API Latency (P95/P99)<br>- User Session Duration          |
| `vr-pod-failure`      | Random termination of one VR/AR pod.         | - Kubernetes successfully rescheduled the pod within 8 seconds.<br>- In-flight requests to the terminated pod failed (HTTP 503).<br>- Active user sessions connected to the pod were dropped. | - Pod Restart Count<br>- HTTP 5xx Error Rate<br>- Active Connections |
| `vr-gpu-stress`       | 90% CPU load and 1GB memory stress.          | - Latency for the affected pod increased by over 500ms.<br>- Liveness probes failed, leading to the pod being restarted.<br>- Downstream services experienced cascading delays. | - CPU/Memory Utilization<br>- Request Processing Time<br>- Liveness Probe Failures |

## 5. Architectural Weaknesses Identified

1.  **Lack of Graceful Connection Handling:** The `vr-pod-failure` experiment revealed that the system does not gracefully handle active user sessions during pod terminations, leading to a poor user experience.
2.  **Insufficient Resource Limits:** The `vr-gpu-stress` test showed that inadequate CPU and memory limits can cause a single pod to degrade the performance of the entire system and its dependencies.
3.  **Missing Circuit Breakers:** The cascading failures observed during the stress test indicate a lack of circuit-breaking mechanisms to isolate failing components.

## 6. Recommendations and Action Plan

| Weakness Identified                  | Proposed Improvement                                                                                                                            | Priority | Owner |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----- |
| Lack of Graceful Connection Handling | Implement connection draining and session migration logic in the application to ensure seamless failover during pod restarts.                     | High     | CTO   |
| Insufficient Resource Limits         | Conduct performance tuning to establish appropriate CPU/Memory requests and limits for the VR/AR pods. Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). | High     | CTO   |
| Missing Circuit Breakers             | Integrate a service mesh like Istio or Linkerd to implement circuit-breaking patterns and improve fault isolation.                                | Medium   | CTO   |

This report will be used to guide the next phase of architectural improvements and inform the global expansion strategy.

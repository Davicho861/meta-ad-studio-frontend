# OWASP ZAP Configuration for AR/VR Penetration Testing
# This configuration extends the existing ZAP scans to include VR-specific security tests.

apiVersion: "zaproxy.org/v1"
kind: "ZAPScan"

  # Standard ZAP scans
  rules:
    - id: "10020" # SQL Injection
      threshold: "HIGH"
    - id: "10021" # Cross Site Scripting
      threshold: "HIGH"
  
  # VR/AR Specific Scans
  # These are conceptual rules. In a real-world scenario, you would need to
  # develop custom ZAP scripts to test for VR-specific vulnerabilities.
